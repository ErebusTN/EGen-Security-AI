## What is Digital Privacy?

Digital privacy is about having control over your personal information online - deciding who can see it, how it's used, and making sure it stays safe. It's like having curtains on your windows so people can't look inside your home without permission!

## Why is Digital Privacy Important?

Your digital information can tell a lot about you:
- Where you go (location data)
- What you like (browsing history)
- Who you talk to (contacts)
- What you look like (photos)
- What you say to friends (messages)

If this information gets into the wrong hands, it could be used to:
- Send you unwanted ads
- Steal your identity
- Figure out when your house is empty
- Bully or embarrass you

## Your Digital Footprint

Everything you do online leaves a trace, like footprints in the sand. This is called your "digital footprint."

There are two types:
1. **Active footprint**: Information you deliberately share (posts, comments, profiles)
2. **Passive footprint**: Information collected without you actively sharing (websites you visit, your location)

Remember: Once information is online, it can be very hard to completely remove it!

## Understanding Privacy Settings

Most apps, games, and websites have privacy settings you can adjust. Here's what to look for:

### Social Media Privacy
- Who can see your posts (everyone, friends only, or specific people)
- Who can send you friend requests
- Whether your profile appears in search results
- If people can tag you in photos

### App Permissions
Apps often ask for access to things like:
- Your camera
- Your microphone
- Your contacts
- Your location

Only give permissions that make sense for what the app does. A flashlight app doesn't need your contacts!

## Personal Information Protection

### 1. Think Before You Share
Before posting anything online, ask yourself:
- Would I be okay with everyone seeing this forever?
- Could this information be used to harm me?
- Am I revealing too much about my location or routine?

### 2. Use Privacy-Focused Tools
Some tools are designed to protect your privacy:
- Private browsing modes
- Search engines that don't track you (like DuckDuckGo)
- Messaging apps with encryption (like Signal)

### 3. Manage Your Cookies
Cookies are small files websites save on your device to remember information about you. They can be helpful but also track your activities.

You can:
- Delete cookies regularly
- Use browser settings to block third-party cookies
- Use extensions that block trackers

## Digital Privacy for Kids and Teens

### Special Considerations
- Many websites require users to be at least 13 years old
- Parents should help younger children manage their privacy
- Learn to use the reporting and blocking features on platforms you use

### Digital Privacy at School
- School computers might monitor what you do
- Be careful what you search for or access on school networks
- Remember that school email accounts may be viewed by administrators

## Practice Activity: Privacy Check-Up

Follow these steps to improve your privacy:
1. Check the privacy settings on your favorite social media app
2. Look at what permissions you've given to apps on your phone
3. Try searching for yourself online - what information is publicly available?
4. Have a conversation with your family about what personal information should stay private

## Summary

Digital privacy is about taking control of your personal information online. By understanding privacy settings, being careful about what you share, and using privacy-focused tools, you can better protect your digital life.

Remember: Your personal information is valuable - treat it that way!
