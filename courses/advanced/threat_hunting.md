**Estimated Time:** 120 minutes

## Introduction

By 2025, reactive security measures are no longer sufficient against sophisticated adversaries who can evade traditional detection methods. Organizations must adopt proactive threat hunting capabilities to identify malicious actors hiding within networks and systems. According to the 2025 Threat Landscape Report, 78% of breaches involve attackers maintaining persistence for more than 30 days before discovery, with the average dwell time being 24 days in organizations without dedicated threat hunting programs.

Threat hunting is the proactive process of searching across networks, endpoints, and data sets to identify malicious, suspicious, or risky activities that have evaded existing security solutions. Unlike traditional detection, which relies on alerts from security tools, threat hunting starts with a hypothesis and leverages both automated tools and human analysis to uncover stealthy threats that may otherwise remain dormant until activated.

This course explores advanced threat hunting methodologies that align with the 2025 threat landscape, focusing on hypothesis formulation, behavioral analysis, and leveraging modern tooling to detect sophisticated attackers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Develop effective threat hunting hypotheses based on threat intelligence and attacker techniques

   - B) Beginning with a theory about adversary activity and testing it
   - C) Searching for specific indicators across systems
   - D) Using automation to detect anomalies

2. Which data source would be most valuable when hunting for identity-based attacks?
   - A) Network flow data
   - B) File system logs
   - C) Authentication and directory service logs
   - D) Process execution logs

3. What is a "Living off the Land" technique?
   - A) Exploiting agricultural systems
   - B) Using legitimate system tools for malicious purposes
   - C) Operating without internet connectivity
   - D) Harvesting credentials from systems

4. Which of the following is NOT a component of the SANS Hunting Maturity Model?
   - A) Initial
   - B) Procedural
   - C) Transformational
   - D) Leading

5. What should ideally happen after a successful threat hunt?
   - A) The findings should be kept confidential
   - B) The hunt process should be repeated exactly the same way
   - C) Findings should be converted into automated detection rules
   - D) Hunters should move to an entirely different hypothesis

6. What is the primary difference between threat hunting and traditional detection?
   - A) Hunting uses better tools than traditional detection
   - B) Hunting is proactive while traditional detection is reactive
   - C) Hunting only focuses on network traffic
   - D) Hunting is fully automated while detection requires manual work

7. Which analytical approach focuses on identifying unusual patterns in user actions compared to their normal behavior?
   - A) Threat intelligence analysis
   - B) Indicator matching
   - C) User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
   - D) Process tree analysis

8. What type of visualization would be most effective for analyzing process creation relationships?
   - A) Pie chart
   - B) Bar graph
   - C) Tree or graph visualization
   - D) Heat map

## Answer Key

1. B) Beginning with a theory about adversary activity and testing it. Hypothesis-driven hunting starts with a theory about potential attacker behavior rather than reacting to alerts.

2. C) Authentication and directory service logs. These logs contain the most relevant information for identifying identity-based attacks like credential theft and privilege escalation.

3. B) Using legitimate system tools for malicious purposes. "Living off the Land" refers to attackers using built-in system tools to avoid detection.

4. C) Transformational. The SANS Hunting Maturity Model includes levels: Initial, Minimal, Procedural, Innovative, and Leading, with "Pioneering" added in recent updates.

5. C) Findings should be converted into automated detection rules. Converting successful hunts into automated detection allows continuous monitoring for similar threats.

6. B) Hunting is proactive while traditional detection is reactive. Hunting actively searches for threats that have evaded existing detection, while traditional detection waits for alerts.

7. C) User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA). UEBA focuses on identifying behavioral anomalies compared to established baselines.

8. C) Tree or graph visualization. Tree or graph visualizations are most effective for showing parent-child relationships and execution chains in process data.

## Glossary

**Threat Hunting:** The proactive process of searching for malicious activity that has evaded traditional detection mechanisms.

**Hypothesis:** A testable statement about potential adversary activity within an environment.

**Behavioral Analytics:** Analysis techniques focused on identifying patterns of behavior rather than specific indicators.

**Threat Intelligence:** Information about threats and adversaries used to inform security operations.

**MITRE ATT&CK:** A globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques.

**Living Off the Land (LOL):** The technique of using legitimate tools and features for malicious purposes.

**User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA):** Security analytics that focus on the behavior of users and entities.

**Detection Engineering:** The process of creating, testing, and deploying detection rules based on understanding of adversary techniques.

**Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Forensic artifacts that identify potentially malicious activity.

**Behavioral Indicators of Compromise (BIoCs):** Patterns of behavior that indicate potentially malicious activity.
