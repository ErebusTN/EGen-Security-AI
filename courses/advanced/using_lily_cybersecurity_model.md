- Requires careful prompt engineering for optimal results

## Setting Up the Environment

To use Lily-Cybersecurity-7B effectively, you'll need to set up an appropriate environment with sufficient computational resources.

### Hardware Requirements

- **CPU**: 8+ cores recommended
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum, 32GB+ recommended
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 16GB+ VRAM (e.g., RTX 3090, A5000, or better)
- **Storage**: 15GB+ for model weights and associated files

### Software Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers accelerate bitsandbytes
   ```

2. **Import Required Libraries**:
   ```python
   import torch
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline
   ```

3. **Initialize the Model**:
   ```python
   from src.ai.models import SecurityModel
   
   # Create the model instance
   model = SecurityModel(
       model_name_or_path="segolilylabs/Lily-Cybersecurity-7B-v0.2",
       device="cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
   )
   ```

### Using Quantization for Efficiency

For resource-constrained environments, you can load the model with quantization:

```python
model = SecurityModel(
    model_name_or_path="segolilylabs/Lily-Cybersecurity-7B-v0.2",
    device="cuda",
    load_in_8bit=True  # Enable 8-bit quantization
)
```

## Basic Threat Detection

The primary use case for Lily-Cybersecurity-7B is detecting and classifying security threats from textual inputs.

### Simple Threat Detection

```python
# Example text to analyze
text = """
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'anything'
"""

# Predict whether the text contains a security threat
result = model.predict(text)

# Check if a threat was detected
if result["is_threat"]:
    print(f"Threat detected: {result['threat_type']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")
else:
    print("No threat detected")
```

### Understanding the Result Object

The `predict()` method returns a dictionary with the following keys:

- `is_threat` (bool): Whether a security threat was detected
- `threat_type` (str): The category of threat (e.g., "sql_injection", "xss", "malware")
- `confidence` (float): Confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0
- `explanation` (str): Detailed explanation of the finding
- `raw_model_output` (str): The raw text generated by the model

### Generating Explanations

To get a detailed explanation of the threat detection result:

```python
# Generate human-readable explanation
explanation = model.generate_explanation(text, result)
print(explanation)
```

Example output:
```
SECURITY THREAT DETECTED: SQL_INJECTION
Confidence: high (0.92)

Analysis: This is a classic SQL injection attack using comment characters (--) 
to bypass password verification. The query is designed to log in as 'admin' 
by commenting out the password check portion of the SQL query.
```

## Advanced Techniques

For more robust security analysis, the EGen Security AI framework provides advanced capabilities with Lily-Cybersecurity-7B.

### Ensemble Methods

Ensemble prediction improves reliability by combining multiple inferences with varied sampling parameters:

```python
from src.ai.models import RobustSecurityModel

# Initialize robust model with ensemble capabilities
robust_model = RobustSecurityModel(
    model_name_or_path="segolilylabs/Lily-Cybersecurity-7B-v0.2",
    ensemble_size=5,  # Use 5 predictions for consensus
    randomness_factor=0.2  # Control variation in sampling
)

# Analyze text using ensemble prediction
result = robust_model.predict(text)

# The result includes ensemble agreement information
print(f"Ensemble agreement: {result['confidence']:.2f}")
```

### Adversarial Detection

Detect potential adversarial examples designed to evade detection:

```python
# Check if text might be adversarial
adv_result = robust_model.adversarial_detection(text)

# Check adversarial detection results
if adv_result["possible_adversarial"]:
    print("Possible adversarial example detected")
    print(f"Verdict consistency: {adv_result['verdict_consistency']:.2f}")
```

## Performance Tuning

Optimize the model's performance for your specific use case.

### Adjusting Confidence Threshold

Fine-tune the confidence threshold to balance precision and recall:

```python
# For high-precision (fewer false positives)
model.confidence_threshold = 0.8

# For high-recall (fewer false negatives)
model.confidence_threshold = 0.6
```

### Batch Processing

For analyzing multiple inputs efficiently:

```python
# List of texts to analyze
texts = [
    "User login successful after 3 attempts",
    "rm -rf / --no-preserve-root",
    "<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>",
    "Password reset requested for user admin"
]

# Batch detect threats
results = model.detect_threats(texts)

# Process results
for i, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Text {i+1}: {'Threat' if result['is_threat'] else 'Benign'}")
```

## Integration with Security Systems

Integrate Lily-Cybersecurity-7B with existing security infrastructure.

### API Integration

Create an API endpoint for threat detection:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Body
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()
model = SecurityModel()

class ThreatDetectionRequest(BaseModel):
    text: str

@app.post("/detect-threat")
async def detect_threat(request: ThreatDetectionRequest):
    result = model.predict(request.text)
    explanation = model.generate_explanation(request.text, result)
    return {
        "is_threat": result["is_threat"],
        "threat_type": result["threat_type"],
        "confidence": result["confidence"],
        "explanation": explanation
    }
```

### Log Analysis Pipeline

Integrate with log analysis systems:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

def analyze_logs(log_file_path):
    results = []
    with open(log_file_path, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            try:
                log_entry = json.loads(line)
                # Extract text to analyze (e.g., message field)
                text = log_entry.get("message", "")
                # Analyze for threats
                result = model.predict(text)
                if result["is_threat"]:
                    results.append({
                        "log_entry": log_entry,
                        "threat_detection": result
                    })
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                continue
    return results
```

## Case Studies

Let's explore real-world applications of Lily-Cybersecurity-7B for security threat detection.

### Case Study 1: Detecting SQL Injection

**Input:**
```
username=admin'; DROP TABLE users; --
```

**Detection Result:**
```
SECURITY THREAT DETECTED: SQL_INJECTION
Confidence: high (0.95)

Analysis: This input contains a SQL injection attack that attempts to drop 
the users table. The attack uses the classic technique of closing the current 
SQL statement with a single quote ('), then injecting a destructive command 
(DROP TABLE users), and finally commenting out the rest of the original query (--).
```

### Case Study 2: Identifying Command Injection

**Input:**
```
ping 8.8.8.8; cat /etc/passwd
```

**Detection Result:**
```
SECURITY THREAT DETECTED: COMMAND_INJECTION
Confidence: medium (0.76)

Analysis: This input contains a command injection attack that uses command 
chaining (;) to execute an unauthorized command. While the ping command is 
legitimate, it's followed by an attempt to read the sensitive /etc/passwd file, 
which could expose system user information.
```

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to get the most out of Lily-Cybersecurity-7B:

1. **Use Ensemble Methods for Critical Systems**: Always enable ensemble prediction for high-security environments where accuracy is paramount.

2. **Fine-tune with Domain-Specific Data**: Consider fine-tuning the model with your organization's specific security data for improved performance.

3. **Implement Human Review**: Use the model as an assistant to human analysts rather than a complete replacement, especially for high-risk decisions.

4. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly evaluate the model's performance against new threats and update as needed.

5. **Implement Rate Limiting**: For API integrations, implement rate limiting to prevent resource exhaustion.

6. **Secure the Model**: Protect the model and its API from unauthorized access to prevent potential misuse.

7. **Stay Updated**: Keep abreast of the latest model versions and security research to maintain effective threat detection.
